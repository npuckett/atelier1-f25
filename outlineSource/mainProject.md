## Main Project â€“ Building Character(s)

**Format**: Individual

### Description
For the main project, you will work to take an existing physical object and convert it into an interactive digital character that operates on your phone. You must design its personality, movement, and appearance in response to inputs. In addition to the methods explored in Workshop 2, we will expand to examine more complex methods of input such as hand/body tracking via the camera. 


### Constraints
- The design must exist as a public url that can be shared with your classmates
- You must create the animated Gif yourself, don't simply use an existing one
- The experience must be designed for phones. No laptops
- Don't do anything that could damage yours or others phones


### Tools
- p5.js
- ML5
- VSCode + Github Copilot
- Github




## Project Steps / Phases

> Project development is never fully linear. You may well have to backtrack during the process, but this is the general structure of how you will develop the work over 6 weeks.

### 1. Choose an Object
Your character must be based on an existing, inanimate, physical object, so first you need to choose one. It can be anything of any size. You will be creating a personality and interactions for this object, so consider how its physical traits can provide hints as to how it will behave.

### 2. Digitize It
Once you have chosen your object, the next step is to decide how you want to bring it into digital space. There are many different techniques (or combinations) you can use including photography, drawing, painting, 3d scanning, videos, or other methods. It is important to consider how this phase can change the object into a character. It should be recognizable, but you should take creative freedom in what you add, delete, or accentuate. This process will likely involve combinations of several techniques and software. Consider how the object can be broken into smaller parts to allow for more complex movement and response.

At this phase we will explore the tools within p5.js that let you dynamically display and manipulate multiple types of media on screen.

### 3. Develop Its Personality and Story
Now that your object is digital you have the freedom to create its backstory and personality.

What is this Creature? What does it like? What does it dislike? What does it want? How does it move? Create this through writings, drawings, renders whatever technique works for you.

### 4. Code the First Interactions
Now that you have a clear plan and visualizations of what you want your character to do, we'll work on converting that to code using p5.js. This conversion can be a bit abstract, but we will look at several techniques that allows you to translate the nuance of your character's personality into response and motion. Start with a few of the core interactions, don't try to implement them all at once.

### 5. Playtest the First Interactions
At this stage you will formally playtest your first interactions with your classmates. It is important to use the materials you created to design the personality of your character to quickly describe your concept. Additionally, you should consider what questions you want to ask. Be specific. There will be several people testing at once, so create a system for gathering feedback.

### 6. Develop Version 2
Building on the Playtest Feedback and overall goals, add and refine your character's interactions. This is the chance to build more detail and move from reactive to interactive systems. To do this, you'll need to consider issues such as memory and evolution of responses over time.

### 7. Playtest Version 2
Like the first round, you will playtest the second version of your character. You will still have time to implement updates, so this is an important round of inputs. For the second version you should also consider how to improve on the way you collect feedback from your testers.

### 8. Project Documentation
Following the second playtest you will have an additional 2 weeks to implement any changes and finishes to your site. In this time you will also create comprehensive documentation which will be posted to the course website.
