## Workshop 2 – Uncommon Everyday

**Format**: Individual

### Description
Workshop 2 requires you to take a new look at an activity you have likely done many times before: Looking at animated gifs on your phone. For this project we will be looking at how to transform this from passive viewing to active participation. You must create an experience that uses one or more of the base modes of interacting with your phone: Touch/scroll, Microphone, or Gyroscope/Accelerometer to control an interaction with an animated Gif. We will use the functionality available in p5.js to enable new ways to read, interpret, and apply the inputs to the gif. 

The goal is to design an interaction that is specific to the Gif's content and movement to create an engaging experience.

### Constraints
- The design must exist as a public url that can be shared with your classmates
- You must create the animated Gif yourself, don't simply use an existing one
- The experience must be designed for phones. No laptops
- Don't do anything that could damage yours or others phones


### Tools
- p5.js
- VSCode + Github Copilot
- Github

### Deliverables

#### Interactive
A web application hosted on a public url that allows users to interact with your gif via their phone's web browser.

#### Documentation
A PDF that contains:
- 100 – 200 word description of the concept and interaction
- URL of the website hosting your experience
- Youtube/vimeo link demonstrating the interaction
- Concept image / drawing describing the interaction
