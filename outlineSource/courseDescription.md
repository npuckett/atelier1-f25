# Atelier 1: Working in Public â€“ Fundamentals of Experimental Interaction Design

In this Atelier we will be looking at the methods, concepts, and tools used to create engaging interactive experiences for the 'public'. We will focus on creating new possibilities for 'screen-based' work that pushes beyond the current expectations for this mode of interaction.

## Schedule
- Wednesdays and Fridays 3:10 - 6:10
- Rm 320, 205 Richmond
- First Class September 3, Last Class November 28

## Course Topics and Objectives

### Designing Tension and Action
How do you get someone to interact? How do they know what to do? What keeps them interested? We will look at examples and techniques for designing interactions at multiple stages of the process.

### Visualization
How do you explain something that doesn't exist yet? Finding ways to visualize your intentions is a key tool for working through your ideas and discussing them with others. This can be drawings, renders, collages, or whatever works best for your process. However, we will be treating these parts of the project as importantly as the prototypes themselves.

### Tools
How do you create the interaction? How do people get to use it? From the technical side, we will be looking at the web-based coding languages of p5.js, ml5, and three.js. This will be done in the context of contemporary coding tools that leverage AI models. No, it doesn't just do the coding for you, so we will be looking at the important fundamentals and tools for writing code.

### Testing & Feedback
How do people respond to the work? Do they act the way you thought they would? The development methods will focus on testing your designs early and often with your classmates.
