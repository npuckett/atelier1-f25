    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="mt-4">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity is a shared responsibility held by all members of the OCAD University community. We uphold the integrity of knowledge-making and creativity: this means obtaining and sharing information responsibly, being respectful and transparent in the way that we use and respond to the work and contributions of others and explicitly acknowledging how such work and contributions inform our own. The University is committed to enforcing the policy and all allegations of academic misconduct will therefore be reported and investigated. The most common type of academic misconduct is plagiarism, that is, deliberately misrepresenting someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas or original visual concepts as your own in written or visual work. Other examples of academic misconduct include misuse of written or visual sources (&ldquo;unintentional plagiarism&rdquo;), cheating during an examination or test, collaborating on assignments without permission, and submitting any work for evaluation that has previously been submitted in another course without prior approval. Read the <a href="https://www.ocadu.ca/about-ocad-u/our-story/policies?combine=1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Misconduct policy</a> to ensure you are well informed.</p>
<h3>Academic Integrity and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)</h3>
<p>The Academic Misconduct policy includes specific guidance (rules/recommendations) around Generative AI (GAI) applications (e.g. Sora, Midjourney, ChatGPT, Replit). GAI can be a powerful tool for research and creative practice, but may not always be relevant or appropriate for use in a course. Use of a GAI application can be a form of academic misconduct. As a student, you have a responsibility to follow the parameters (rules) set by your instructor for the use of GAI in your course. Parameters for acceptable GAI use vary from course to course and even assignment to assignment. Consult your course outline and assignment instructions for guidance on how these applications may be used and how they should be attributed (referenced) when you do use them. When unclear or in doubt, reach out to your course instructor for clarification.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">Student Feedback on Courses</h2>
<p>OCAD University is committed to ensuring excellence in teaching and learning. As you approach the end of the course you will be asked to complete an online course evaluation during class time on your laptop or other web-enabled device. Your feedback is valued by faculty and is an important part of on-going efforts to enhance course design and teaching across the university. If you have immediate concerns about the teaching of your course, please bring them to your course instructor or Chair.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">University Policies</h2>
<p>As a student, you are responsible for being familiar with the academic policies, procedures and guidelines. University policies and procedures are subject to change and are not tied to a specific academic year, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="/courses/sis_course_id:21971/external_tools/80" target="_top">Policies &amp; Resources</a> page.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">Commitment to Sustainability</h2>
<p>OCAD University is committed to developing decolonial approaches to sustainability that foster environmental justice through interdisciplinary solutions. To address the climate crisis, you are encouraged to approach your art, design, creative and critical practices with an understanding of the interconnections among environmental, social, economic and cultural activities. You may also consult the OCAD U <a href="https://www.ocadu.ca/about-ocad-u/our-story/policies?combine=13.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainability Policy</a> which builds on the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)</a> in support of ecologically-informed and holistic thinking that cultivates relationships between people, place, and land. Together we can advance global sustainability goals which include, among others: reduced inequalities; good health and well-being; affordable and clean energy; clean water and sanitation; climate action; and responsible consumption and production.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="mt-4">Production Materials Fees and Laptop Fees</h2>
<p>In applicable courses, production materials fees cover the costs of materials consumed and/or incorporated in the making of student work in the shops and studios. Production materials fees are automatically added to your online fees account at the time of course registration, and are due in full by the first tuition payment deadline in August. Production materials fees are non-refundable after the last day to change courses with a 100% refund, as outlined in the Calendar.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">Disclaimer Statement</h2>
<p>This course outline may be amended as the course proceeds. The class will be notified and consulted about all changes. In keeping with the Grading Policy, once the course outline has been presented, no change in grade weighting may take place unless there is unanimous consent of all students present. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, notice must be given at a regularly scheduled class meeting previous to the class at which the issue is to be decided.</p>
