Overview
A critical part of any interactive project is to document it well. These works are always temporary, so it is important that you clearly capture the project for your portfolio. Documentation allows you to show the project in its best light, and also allows you to reflect on the process of making it. This isn't about proving that you made something, it is an opportunity for you to capture and archive the work.

Format
All documentation is to be created as a post on the course WordPress site.
