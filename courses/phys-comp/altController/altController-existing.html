<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Create a custom controller for the classic arcade game <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pong</a>, which was first released in 1972. The controls for the game are quite simple: you can move a 2d paddle up or down to reflect the bouncing ball. You will develop a new and novel controller for the game that examines and pushes what is possible with this seemingly simple gameplay. Do not copy existing controller types or look to controllers that simply make the game easier (that is boring...), instead you should create an object, objects, or installation that playfully explore new possibilities for this classic game.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Digital Inputs</h3>
<p>One of the most common first steps when working with Arduino, is to use learn the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/digital-io/digitalread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digitalRead()</a> command. This command allows your program to read whether or not a specified pin is receiving voltage or not and converts the information to either:&nbsp; <strong><em>0</em></strong> (No Voltage) or <strong><em>1</em></strong> (Voltage). This action is typically associated with reading whether or not a button is being pressed, but for this project you are to push beyond a standard button to understand what else can be sensed when you create your own digital sensor. Digital sensors can be created from any material or object that can conduct electricity.</p>
<p>A few examples of what these types of sensors can detect</p>
<ul>
    <li>Presence/Absence of a person or object</li>
    <li>Speed / Rates of Change</li>
    <li>Direction</li>
</ul>
<h3>DF Pong</h3>
<p>Your controller will connect to a custom version of the game that was created for this project : <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://digitalfuturesocadu.github.io/df-pong/game/physComp26-502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DF Pong</a>. This version of the game connects with your Arduino Uno R4 Wifi via Bluetooth to allow any 2 controllers to compete in a match. The game uses a very simple protocol to control the movement</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 - UP</li>
    <li>0 - DON'T MOVE</li>
    <li>2 - DOWN</li>
</ul>
<p>This connection is enabled by the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/DigitalFuturesOCADU/df-pong-controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DFPongController</a> library that handles the connection with the game and sending the control data</p>
<h3>Design Constraints</h3>
<p>Some basic and rigid constraints that will improve your controller</p>
<ul>
    <li>Do Not copy existing Game controller formats.
        <ul>
            <li>This includes both the form of the controller and inputs</li>
            <li>Don't just re-create existing buttons</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do Not use any off the shelf buttons - You must make your own inputs</li>
    <li>Wire your own LED Indicator to work with the library's <em><strong>setStatusLED()&nbsp;</strong></em>method</li>
    <li>Do Not base the controller on stuffed animals or weapons (both are boring for their own reasons)</li>
    <li>Create the controller with a robust design that will allow it to be used with the Pong Game</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design Goals and Considerations</h3>
<p>Push the limits of what can be even considered a controller, but also</p>
<ul>
    <li>Consider the overall craft and finish of the design</li>
    <li>Consider how the material, mass, and scale of the controller can impact it's use and gameplay</li>
    <li>Avoid simply sticking it inside an existing box. Fabricate it yourself</li>
    <li>Look to fully encase the Arduino, wiring, battery, and sensors
        <ul>
            <li>Don't glue it together. Use connection methods that allow access</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Avoid loose and tangled wires</li>
    <li>Create electrical and material connections that will hold up to use</li>
    <li>Integrate an indicator LED that displays the controller's connection state</li>
</ul>
