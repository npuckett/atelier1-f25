                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Components Used: Arduino, Servo Motor, Light Sensor</p>
                <p>This project focuses on creating kinetic sculptures that manipulate light and shadow. It will also focus on a principle of lightness through the choice of materials. The goal is create unconventional kinetic movements that evolve over time.</p>
                <p>Create a kinetic sculpture that uses your servo motor to control a mechanism that is primarily made up of very lightweight materials: paper, vellum, fabric, etc. The goal to investigate how the mechanical, rotational movement of the servo can be transformed through code and mechanisms. In addition to the material itself, the sculpture should manipulate light and shadow in specific ways. The system will read input from a Light Sensor to affect and change its movement over time.</p>
