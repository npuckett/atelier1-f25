Overview
AI Coding tools have rapidly changed over the past year and now represent a new skill set for developing code.
It isn't simply a "It just does it for you", there are specific methods and concepts that are now core.
Even if your project isn't coding-heavy, these are things you should at least be aware of as they 
provide immense opportunity for creating things that were not previously possible.

Preparation
To work with these tools, you will need to set up several things using this guide: https://digitalfuturesocadu.github.io/vsCodeSetup/guide/


Activity
We will be looking at general workflow for working with coding agents inside VS Code. There are many
other platforms where this is possible, but we are with it because you get access to Copilot Pro free
with your ocad email.

Format - Individual or groups of 2-3

Develop an interactive web app using either p5.js or three.js that is related to your project(s) in some way.
The app should specifically attempt something that you haven't done before in terms of complexity

Deliverable
Create a post with a short description of your webapp and a link to it. The description should include
a short overview of how you used the tools
