Overview
This workshop asks you to investigate the broader implications of the work you are making. Well
developed work has many different angles, and this will help you to frame your work in a context 
broder than "Making a Thing"

Questions
Unlike classical research, your project does not HAVE to be answering a specific question or solving 
a specific problem. It can, but it isn't required.
However, your project should be able to be framed as being a vehicle to investigate an idea or ideas. 
This is the point with making the work. You create it to figure things out. The field of inquiry could 
fall into one/more of these topics

Why Bother?
Thinking through your project through this lens has several practical implications:
- Helps to organize the project into smaller subcategories
- Gives the project more depth 
- Gives the project more 'surface area'. IE it means that there is more than one way it can engage an audience

Pitfalls
Don't make grandiose claims that you can't back up (ChatGPT has made this 100X worse.) Everyone gags at BS project descriptions
- Write about the work in a way that you would actually speak about it. Avoid superlatives and extra adverbs
- Focus on smaller issues that you can actually pull off
- Worrying too much at the beginning. You have to make the thing to figure it out. What the project is 'about'
will very likely change along the way. That is to be expected 

Activity
Part 1: Reading
Book LINK : https://canvascloud.ocadu.ca/courses/12811/files/folder/Books?preview=4477601
You will be reading a few short portions of the book Hands On Research for Artists & Designers, 
which is focused on this topic. 


Part 2: Writing
Develop first versions of topics/questions that your project *might* look at. Again, you haven't made it yet, but you should make
some first guesses. These questions can fall into these general categories

- Technical
Within the work you are developing specific tools or techniques for the project to work
- Visual
The work specifically develops new methods/techniques for the visual content
- Conceptual
The work is used to explore particular concepts in new ways
- Interactive
The work explores new methods of interaction.
- Something Else


Write out questions for each topic. (You can have more than 1 per topic)
Sort by relevance to your work.
- Delete the weakest ones
- Make a hierarchy of Most/Least relevant ones that remain


Part 3: Drawing
In parallel to work on what the project might be about, you also need to think about what it could look like.
Using the paper template + markers/pens/crayons provided, create first sketches of what the project might look like.
- Project Title : an idea of what you want to call it
- Image / Wireframe : This will be different depending on what medium your project exists in. 

Try and capture what your project is about as a single drawing.
Create more than 1

Even if you are working in a group, each person should complete this.
