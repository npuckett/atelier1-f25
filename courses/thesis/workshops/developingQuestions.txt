Overview
Regardless of the type of project you are building, testing it is a critical method for its development.
It is important to have something to test, but it is also important to ask effective questions so that
you receive the most useful information. In preparation for Playtest 1, you will be creating, developing, and refining
your questions.


Activity
Working in groups of 4-5 we will be going through several rounds to actively develop your platest questions.
