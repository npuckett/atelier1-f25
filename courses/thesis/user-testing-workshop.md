## Developing Questions for Your First User Test: Early-Stage Prototypes

---

## Workshop Overview

This in-class workshop guides you through developing effective questions for your upcoming user testing sessions. By the end of this workshop, you will have a complete set of testing questions ready to use.

### Credit-Level Deliverables

| Credit Level | Testing Sessions | Questions per Session | Total Questions |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **0.5 Credit** | 1 session | 3-4 questions | 3-4 questions |
| **1.0 Credit** | 2 sessions | 3-4 questions each | 6-8 questions |

**1.0 Credit Students:** Your two testing sessions should target different aspects of your project or different user groups. This workshop will help you develop distinct question sets for each session.

## What You're Testing (And What You're Not)

Since you're testing **early-stage, in-progress work**, focus on validating core ideas and fundamental functionality before investing more development time.

### Test These Things Now

**For Games:**
- Core concepts: "Does this mechanic make sense?"
- Fundamental interactions: "Can users understand this control scheme?"
- Challenge comprehension: "Do players know what they're trying to accomplish?"

**For Interactive Installations:**
- Spatial understanding: "Do people know where to stand/approach?"
- Interaction discovery: "Can visitors figure out how to activate it?"
- Cause-and-effect comprehension: "Do users understand their actions create responses?"

**For Static and Motion Media:**
- Visual hierarchy: "What do viewers see first?"
- Message comprehension: "Do people understand the main idea?"
- Pacing and clarity: "Is the timing effective for understanding?"

**For UX/App Projects:**
- Task comprehension: "Do users understand what they can do here?"
- Navigation clarity: "Can users find their way around?"
- Mental model alignment: "Does the structure match user expectations?"

### Save These for Later

- Visual polish or final aesthetics
- Complete content or all features
- Performance optimization
- Edge cases or rare scenarios
- Final materials or fabrication quality

## Workshop Steps

Complete each step in order. 1.0 credit students will repeat certain steps for their second testing session.

---

## Step 1: Define Your Project Type and Current State (5 minutes)

Before developing questions, clearly identify what you're working with.

### A. Select Your Primary Medium

Check the category that best describes your thesis project:

- [ ] Game / Interactive Digital Experience
- [ ] Art Installation / Interactive Experience
- [ ] Static Media (Poster, Graphic, Information Design)
- [ ] Motion Media (Animation, Video, Motion Graphics)
- [ ] UX/App Project / Digital Interface

### B. Describe Your Prototype's Current State

**What exists in your prototype right now:**
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________

**What is missing (testers should ignore these):**
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________

### C. Write Your Framing Statement

Use this template to explain your prototype to testers:

> "This is an early [prototype/mockup/concept] of [describe project]. It doesn't have [list 2-3 missing elements] yet. I want to learn: [your focus]. Please focus on [what to pay attention to], not [what to ignore]."

**Your framing statement:**

_______________________________________________

_______________________________________________

_______________________________________________

---

## Step 2: Identify Your Critical Assumptions (10 minutes)

List the assumptions you're making about how users will interact with your work. These become the basis for your questions.

### A. List 5-7 Assumptions

Write assumptions in the format: "Users will _____" or "People will understand _____"

**Installation examples:**
- "Visitors will see this from across the room first"
- "People will understand this is interactive, not passive art"
- "The interaction zone is clear without floor markings"

**Visual/Motion examples:**
- "Viewers will read the headline before the body copy"
- "The animation will be watched from beginning to end"
- "Viewers will understand the visual metaphor"

**UX/App examples:**
- "Users will understand the tab structure"
- "People will know to swipe/scroll to see more"
- "The search icon will be noticed"

**Your assumptions:**

1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________
4. _______________________________________________
5. _______________________________________________
6. _______________________________________________
7. _______________________________________________

### B. Rank by Risk

Mark each assumption with a risk level:

- **Critical (C):** If wrong, the project fundamentally fails
- **Important (I):** If wrong, significant problems occur
- **Minor (M):** If wrong, still mostly works

Go back and add C, I, or M next to each assumption above.

---

## Step 3: Identify Your Single Most Critical Question (5 minutes)

From your Critical-ranked assumptions, determine the ONE thing you absolutely must learn from this test.

**Your critical question:**

_______________________________________________

_______________________________________________

**For 1.0 Credit Students Only:**

You need two testing sessions. Identify what makes them different:

**Session 1 Focus:** _______________________________________________

**Session 2 Focus:** _______________________________________________

Options for differentiating sessions:
- Different aspects of the project (e.g., navigation vs. content comprehension)
- Different user groups (e.g., novice vs. experienced users)
- Different prototype states (e.g., paper prototype vs. digital prototype)
- Different features or flows

---

## Step 4: Convert Assumptions to Questions (15 minutes)

Transform your high-risk assumptions into non-leading, open-ended questions.

### Question Writing Rules

**Avoid:**
- Yes/No questions ("Is this clear?")
- Leading questions ("Don't you think this is intuitive?")
- Jargon ("Is the affordance obvious?")
- Asking about polish when testing function

**Use:**
- Open-ended questions ("What do you notice first?")
- Task-based prompts ("Try to find...")
- Observation requests ("Show me where you would...")

### Common Mistake Fixes

| Bad Question | Why It's Bad | Better Question |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| "Is the navigation clear?" | Yes/No, leading | "How would you get to [section]?" |
| "Do you like this?" | Subjective preference | "What does this communicate to you?" |
| "Is it obvious what to do?" | Leading | "What would you try first?" |
| "Can you figure this out?" | Vague, yes/no | "What can you do on this screen?" |
| "Was that too fast?" | Leading toward one answer | "How was the pacing?" |

### Your Draft Questions

Convert your Critical and Important assumptions into questions:

**Question 1** (from assumption #___):

_______________________________________________

**Question 2** (from assumption #___):

_______________________________________________

**Question 3** (from assumption #___):

_______________________________________________

**Question 4** (from assumption #___):

_______________________________________________

**Question 5** (from assumption #___):

_______________________________________________

**Question 6** (from assumption #___):

_______________________________________________

## Step 5: Organize Questions by Testing Phase (10 minutes)

Sort your questions into the three phases of a testing session.

### Pre-Test Questions (Context Gathering)
Establish user background before they see the prototype.

Example questions:
- "Have you used apps like this before?"
- "What's your experience with interactive art?"
- "How do you usually [relevant activity]?"

**Your pre-test question(s):**

_______________________________________________

### During-Test Questions (Observation)
Ask while users interact with the prototype. Use Think Aloud prompts.

Example questions:
- "What are you trying to do right now?"
- "What do you expect will happen?"
- "Where would you look for [feature]?"

**Your during-test questions:**

1. _______________________________________________

2. _______________________________________________

### Post-Test Questions (Reflection)
Ask after the interaction is complete.

Example questions:
- "What was the hardest part?"
- "What would you change about this?"
- "Would you use/experience this again? Why?"

**Your post-test question(s):**

_______________________________________________

---

## Step 6: Peer Review and Refinement (10 minutes)

Pair up with a classmate (ideally working in a different medium) to review each other's questions.

### Review Checklist

For each of your partner's questions, check:

- [ ] Is it open-ended (not yes/no)?
- [ ] Is it non-leading (doesn't suggest the answer)?
- [ ] Does it test something that exists in the prototype (not missing features)?
- [ ] Is it focused on one thing?
- [ ] Would a user understand it without explanation?

### Feedback Notes

**Questions that need revision:**

_______________________________________________

_______________________________________________

**Suggested improvements:**

## Step 7: Finalize Your Question Set (5 minutes)

Based on peer feedback, write your final testing questions.

### 0.5 Credit Students: Final Question Set (3-4 questions)

**Session 1:**

1. _______________________________________________

2. _______________________________________________

3. _______________________________________________

4. _______________________________________________

### 1.0 Credit Students: Final Question Sets (3-4 questions per session)

**Session 1 Focus:** _______________________________

1. _______________________________________________

2. _______________________________________________

3. _______________________________________________

4. _______________________________________________

**Session 2 Focus:** _______________________________

1. _______________________________________________

2. _______________________________________________

3. _______________________________________________

4. _______________________________________________

## Step 8: Prepare Your Testing Script (5 minutes)

Combine your framing statement with your questions into a complete script.

### Testing Script Template

**Introduction (say this first):**
> [Your framing statement from Step 1]

**Think Aloud Instruction (say before they begin):**
> "Please say out loud everything you're thinking as you [interact/use/view] this. Tell me what you're looking at, what you're thinking, what you're trying to do, and how you're feeling."

**Your Questions (in order):**

Pre-test: _______________________________________________

During test: _______________________________________________

During test: _______________________________________________

Post-test: _______________________________________________

**Neutral Prompts (use as needed during test):**
- "Keep thinking out loud"
- "What are you thinking right now?"
- "What did you expect to happen?"
- "Tell me more about that"

## Quick Reference: Medium-Specific Starter Questions

If you're stuck, choose from these proven questions for your medium:

### For Installation Testing:
1. "What is this?" (concept comprehension)
2. "How would you interact with it?" (interaction model)
3. "Where would you stand/position yourself?" (spatial relationship)
4. "What do you think causes it to respond?" (cause-effect understanding)
5. "How does being in this space make you feel?" (emotional impact)

### For Visual Media Testing:
1. "What do you notice first?" (hierarchy)
2. "What is this communicating?" (message clarity)
3. "From where you're standing, what can you read?" (readability)
4. "What's the mood or feeling of this?" (aesthetic appropriateness)
5. "Who is this for?" (audience appropriateness)

### For Motion Media Testing:
1. "What just happened?" (sequence comprehension)
2. "Was that too fast, too slow, or just right?" (pacing)
3. "Where were you looking?" (attention tracking)
4. "Could you follow the whole sequence?" (continuity)
5. "Would you watch this again?" (engagement)

### For UX/App Testing:
1. "How would you [complete specific task]?" (task completion)
2. "Where would you look for [feature]?" (navigation)
3. "What do you expect this button/link to do?" (mental model)
4. "Can you get back to where you started?" (orientation)
