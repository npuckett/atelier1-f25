# Developing Effective User Testing Questions: Early-Stage & In-Progress Work
## A Comprehensive Workshop Guide for Games, Interactive Installations, Visual/Motion Media, and UX/App Projects

## Overview

This guide is designed for students testing **early-stage, in-progress work** across four domains:

### Games & Interactive Digital Experiences
- Prototypes and core mechanics
- Control schemes and player feedback
- Game flow and challenge progression

### Art Installations & Interactive Experiences
- Spatial and environmental concepts
- Physical interaction models
- Sensor-based and responsive systems
- Multi-user and social interactions

### Static & Motion Media
- Posters, graphics, and information design
- Animations and motion graphics
- Video content and sequential narratives
- Interactive visual interfaces

### UX/App Projects & Digital Interfaces
- Mobile and web applications
- Interactive prototypes and wireframes
- Navigation systems and information architecture
- User flows and task completion
- Interface components and interactions

**Key difference from late-stage testing:** You're not testing polish or completeness—you're validating core ideas, interaction models, visual communication, spatial experiences, and fundamental usability before investing more development time.

## Early-Stage Testing Philosophy

### What You're Testing vs. What You're NOT Testing

#### ✅ DO Test Early On:

**For Games:**
- Core concepts: "Does this mechanic make sense?"
- Fundamental interactions: "Can users understand this control scheme?"
- Challenge comprehension: "Do players know what they're trying to accomplish?"

**For Interactive Installations:**
- Spatial understanding: "Do people know where to stand/approach?"
- Interaction discovery: "Can visitors figure out how to activate it?"
- Cause-and-effect comprehension: "Do users understand their actions create responses?"
- Social dynamics: "How do multiple people navigate the space?"
- Emotional resonance: "Does this create the intended atmosphere?"

**For Static & Motion Media:**
- Visual hierarchy: "What do viewers see first?"
- Message comprehension: "Do people understand the main idea?"
- Aesthetic impact: "What emotional response does this create?"
- Readability: "Can the text be read from the intended distance?"
- Motion clarity: "Does the animation communicate the intended action?"
- Pacing: "Is the timing effective for understanding?"

**For UX/App Projects:**
- Task comprehension: "Do users understand what they can do here?"
- Navigation clarity: "Can users find their way around?"
- Mental model alignment: "Does the structure match user expectations?"
- Action affordances: "Do users know what's tappable/clickable?"
- Information scent: "Can users predict where links/buttons lead?"
- Error recovery: "Can users get unstuck when confused?"

#### ❌ DON'T Worry About (Yet):
- Visual polish or final aesthetics (unless testing visual communication specifically)
- Complete content or all features
- Performance optimization
- Edge cases or rare scenarios
- Perfect balance or tuning
- Final materials or fabrication quality
- Production-level rendering or effects
- Comprehensive feature sets

## Medium-Specific Testing Priorities

Understanding what's most critical to test for each medium helps focus your early-stage work.

### Games: Interaction & Feedback Loops

**Critical early tests:**
1. **Core mechanic comprehension** - Can players figure out what to do?
2. **Control intuitiveness** - Do inputs feel natural?
3. **Feedback clarity** - Can players tell success from failure?
4. **Challenge communication** - Do players understand goals?

**Can wait until later:**
- Level progression and balance
- Narrative polish
- Enemy variety
- Achievement systems

---

### Interactive Installations: Spatial & Social Experience

**Critical early tests:**
1. **Discoverability** - Do people notice the interactive elements?
2. **Approachability** - Do visitors feel invited to interact or intimidated?
3. **Interaction model** - Can people figure out how to trigger responses?
4. **Spatial flow** - Where do people naturally stand/move?
5. **Cause-and-effect clarity** - Do users understand their actions create results?
6. **Social navigation** - How do multiple visitors share the space?
7. **Emotional tone** - Does the space feel welcoming/mysterious/playful as intended?
8. **Duration of engagement** - How long do people naturally interact?

**Can wait until later:**
- Final materials and finishes
- Production lighting design
- Audio quality and mix
- Durability and maintenance
- Advanced sensor calibration

**Unique considerations for installations:**
- **Space is part of the interface** - test spatial arrangement early
- **Bodies in space matter** - physical comfort, reach, sightlines
- **Social dynamics emerge** - one person vs. groups behave differently
- **Context affects interpretation** - gallery vs. public space vs. outdoor
- **Approach angle matters** - what people see from 20ft vs. 5ft vs. touching

---

### Static & Motion Media: Visual Communication & Clarity

**Critical early tests:**

**For Static (Posters, Graphics, Layouts):**
1. **Visual hierarchy** - What's seen first, second, third?
2. **Message clarity** - Main idea understood in 3-5 seconds?
3. **Readability** - Legible from intended viewing distance?
4. **Information architecture** - Can viewers find specific info?
5. **Aesthetic appropriateness** - Does the style fit the purpose/audience?

**For Motion (Animation, Video, Motion Graphics):**
1. **Timing & pacing** - Is information digestible at this speed?
2. **Motion clarity** - Does movement enhance or obscure meaning?
3. **Continuity** - Can viewers follow the sequence?
4. **Emphasis** - Does motion draw attention to the right elements?
5. **Emotional pacing** - Does rhythm match intended feeling?
6. **Key frames vs. transitions** - Are important moments visible long enough?

**Can wait until later:**
- Final color correction
- Detailed texturing
- Sound design (for motion)
- Final typography refinement
- Production rendering quality

**Unique considerations for static/motion media:**
- **Context of viewing matters** - screen vs. print vs. projection
- **Distance affects perception** - test at actual viewing distance
- **Attention span is limited** - especially for motion work
- **Cultural literacy varies** - symbols and metaphors need testing
- **Accessibility is critical** - color blindness, contrast, readability
- **Sequential vs. simultaneous** - how information unfolds over time (motion) or space (static)

---

### UX/App Projects: Usability & Mental Models

**Critical early tests:**

1. **Navigation comprehension** - Can users find what they need?
2. **Task completion** - Can users accomplish their goals?
3. **Mental model alignment** - Does the organization make sense to users?
4. **Affordances** - Do users know what's interactive?
5. **Information architecture** - Is content grouped logically?
6. **Primary flows** - Can users complete the most important tasks?
7. **Error prevention & recovery** - Can users get unstuck?
8. **Onboarding clarity** - Do new users understand what to do first?

**Can wait until later:**
- Visual design refinement
- Micro-interactions and animations
- Loading states and edge cases
- Comprehensive content
- Performance optimization
- Advanced features
- Error message copywriting

**Unique considerations for UX/apps:**
- **Context of use matters** - mobile vs. desktop, standing vs. sitting, distracted vs. focused
- **Prior experience affects expectations** - users bring mental models from other apps
- **Input method changes everything** - touch vs. mouse vs. keyboard
- **Screen size constrains design** - what works on desktop may fail on mobile
- **Users scan, don't read** - information must be findable quickly
- **Errors are inevitable** - recovery paths are as important as happy paths
- **One-handed use** - especially critical for mobile interfaces

**Key early-stage questions:**
- "Can users complete core tasks without help?"
- "Do navigation labels match user expectations?"
- "Can users recover from mistakes?"
- "Is the information architecture intuitive?"

## Framing Incomplete Work for Testing

### The Critical Introduction

When presenting in-progress work, you must frame it properly or users will focus on the wrong things.

#### General Template:

**"This is an early prototype/mockup/concept. I'm testing [SPECIFIC THING], not the overall polish. The [list incomplete elements] aren't finished yet, so please ignore those. I want to know if [CORE QUESTION]."**

---

#### Medium-Specific Framing Examples:

**Game prototype:**
"This is a rough prototype testing the core jumping mechanic. The graphics are placeholders, there's no sound, and it only has one level. I want to know: can you figure out how to control the character and does the jumping feel responsive?"

**Installation mockup:**
"This is a cardboard and foam-core mockup of an interactive sculpture. The final version will have LED lights, projected visuals, and sound, but right now I'm testing the physical form and interaction points. I want to know: do people understand where to interact, and does the scale feel right for the space?"

**Poster wireframe:**
"This is a low-resolution sketch testing information hierarchy. The final will have custom typography and photography, but right now I'm testing: what catches your eye first, and can you find the key information within 5 seconds?"

**Animation animatic:**
"This is a rough storyboard with timing. There's no color, refined movement, or sound yet. I'm testing whether the sequence of events is clear and whether the pacing feels right. Focus on: can you follow the story, and does the timing work?"

**App wireframe:**
"This is a clickable wireframe testing navigation and flow. There's no visual design, real content, or all the features yet. I'm testing whether you can find what you need and complete basic tasks. Focus on: can you figure out where to go and what to do?"

**Interactive projection concept:**
"This is a video mockup showing what the projection mapping could look like. The actual installation will respond to people in real-time, but right now I'm testing: does the visual concept work on this surface, and is it clear this would be interactive?"

---

### Setting Expectations by Medium

#### For Installation/Spatial Work:
1. **What it is:** "This is a [scale model/mockup/space plan] of [installation type]"
2. **What's missing:** "It doesn't have [final materials/lighting/sound/sensors] yet"
3. **What you're testing:** "I'm specifically trying to learn if [spatial relationship/interaction model/emotional tone] works"
4. **What to focus on:** "Please think about how you'd move through this space and where you'd want to interact"

#### For Visual/Motion Work:
1. **What it is:** "This is a [sketch/wireframe/animatic/style frame] of [final piece]"
2. **What's missing:** "Final [typography/color/illustration/animation/sound] isn't here yet"
3. **What you're testing:** "I'm specifically trying to learn if [hierarchy/clarity/pacing/emotion] is working"
4. **What to focus on:** "Please focus on [what you see first/whether you understand the message/if the timing feels right]"

#### For UX/App Work:
1. **What it is:** "This is a [wireframe/clickable prototype/lo-fi mockup] of [app/website/interface]"
2. **What's missing:** "There's no [visual design/real content/error messages/all features] yet"
3. **What you're testing:** "I'm specifically trying to learn if [navigation makes sense/you can complete tasks/the organization is logical]"
4. **What to focus on:** "Please try to [accomplish specific task] and tell me what you're thinking as you go"

### The "Wizard of Oz" Technique

#### For Installations:
For interactions not yet implemented:
- **You manually trigger responses** while visitors perform actions
- **Example (sensor-based):** Visitor waves hand → you trigger light change with hidden remote
- **Example (projection):** Visitor steps on marked spot → you advance video to response state
- **Example (sound-reactive):** Visitor makes sound → you trigger visual response with keyboard

**Tell visitors upfront:** "The sensors aren't working yet, so I'll trigger the responses manually when you interact. Just do what feels natural and I'll make it respond."

#### For Apps/Interfaces:
For features not yet implemented:
- **You advance screens manually** while users tap/click
- **Example (search):** User types → you show pre-made results
- **Example (form submission):** User fills form → you manually show success state
- **Example (dynamic content):** User scrolls → you show next section manually

**Tell users upfront:** "Some features aren't working yet, so I'll advance the screens manually. Just tap/click where you would naturally and tell me what you're trying to do."

## Core Testing Concepts

### The Three Testing Phases (Adapted for All Media)

#### Pre-Test Questions (Context Gathering)
- Establish user background and expectations
- Understand familiarity with similar experiences
- Set baseline before prototype influences them
- **For installations:** Gauge comfort with interactive art/spatial experiences
- **For visual media:** Establish visual literacy and cultural context
- **For apps:** Understand technical proficiency and similar app usage

#### During-Test Questions (Observation-Focused)
- Prompt real-time feedback on core elements
- Uncover comprehension of fundamental interactions
- Identify confusion points in isolated elements
- **For installations:** Observe spatial navigation and body language
- **For visual media:** Track eye movement and viewing sequence
- **For apps:** Monitor navigation choices and hesitation points

#### Post-Test Questions (Reflection)
- Concept validation
- Comparison to expectations
- Assessment of core idea viability
- **For installations:** Emotional impact and desire to revisit
- **For visual media:** Memorability and message retention
- **For apps:** Task success and confidence level

---

### The Golden Rules (Adapted for All Media)

#### DO:
- ✅ Test **one core thing at a time**
- ✅ Ask about **concepts and communication**, not execution quality
- ✅ Focus on **understanding and comprehension**, not aesthetic preference
- ✅ **For installations:** Observe spatial behavior without directing it
- ✅ **For visual media:** Test at actual viewing distance/context
- ✅ **For apps:** Give real tasks, not guided tours
- ✅ Use **lo-fi prototypes** shamelessly—they often get better feedback
- ✅ Explicitly tell users **what to ignore**

#### DON'T:
- ❌ Apologize for **incompleteness**
- ❌ Test **everything at once**
- ❌ Ask about **polish** unless that's specifically your focus
- ❌ **For installations:** Position people—let them find their own stance
- ❌ **For visual media:** Explain what they should see—let them discover
- ❌ **For apps:** Give step-by-step instructions—see if they can figure it out
- ❌ Build more before **validating core assumptions**

**For Static Media:**
- "Does the main message stand out first?"
- "Can viewers understand the hierarchy?"
- "Is this readable from [distance]?"
- "Does the visual style communicate the right tone?"

**For Motion Media:**
- "Can viewers follow the sequence?"
- "Is the pacing too fast/slow?"

- "Are key moments visible long enough?"

**For UX/Apps:**
- "Can users find [critical feature] without help?"
- "Does the navigation structure make sense?"
- "Can users complete [core task] successfully?"
- "Do users understand what they can do on this screen?"
- "Does the organization match user expectations?"

Only write questions about what exists.

---

### Step 3: Write Concept-Level Questions First

Before testing execution, validate the concept:

#### For Installation Concepts:
- "Based on this description, what do you imagine this experience would be like?"
- "Does this concept sound inviting or intimidating to you?"
- "In a gallery/public space, would you approach this? Why or why not?"
- "What would you expect to feel when interacting with this?"
- "How is this different from other interactive art you've experienced?"

#### For Visual/Motion Concepts:
- "Based on this sketch, what do you think this is trying to communicate?"
- "What mood or feeling does this concept suggest?"
- "Who do you think this is for?"
- "What would you expect the final version to look like?"
- "Does this concept feel appropriate for [context/purpose]?"

#### For UX/App Concepts:
- "Based on this description, what do you think this app does?"
- "How is this different from other [type of app] you've used?"
- "What would you expect to be able to do with this?"
- "Who do you think this is for?"
- "If this existed, would you use it? Why or why not?"
- "What's confusing about the concept?"

#### Comprehension Questions:
- "What do you think you can do on this screen?"
- "How would you [accomplish specific task]?"
- "Where would you expect to find [feature]?"
- "What do you think happens when you tap this?"

---

### Step 4: Write Medium-Specific Core Questions

#### For Installations:
**Spatial Questions:**
- "Where would you naturally stand to experience this?"
- "How much space do you feel you need around you?"
- "Can you show me where you think you'd interact?"

**Interaction Questions:**
- "How do you think you activate this?"
- "What would you try first?"
- "How do you know it's responding to you?"

**Social Questions:**
- "Could another person interact at the same time as you?"
- "Would you want to experience this alone or with others?"
- "How would you take turns/share this?"

**Emotional Questions:**
- "How does being in this space make you feel?"
- "What's the atmosphere like?"
- "Does this feel welcoming or exclusive?"

#### For Visual Media:
**Hierarchy Questions:**
- "What's the first thing you notice?"
- "What do you look at second? Third?"
- "Point to the most important information"

**Comprehension Questions:**
- "In one sentence, what is this communicating?"
- "What action should you take after seeing this?"
- "What details did you miss on first glance?"

**Aesthetic Questions:**
- "What mood or tone does this create?"
- "What does the visual style tell you about this?"

#### For Motion Media:
**Pacing Questions:**
- "Was that too fast, too slow, or just right?"
- "Could you follow what was happening?"
- "Which part felt rushed or dragged?"

**Motion Clarity Questions:**
- "What is moving in this sequence?"
- "Where were you looking during [specific moment]?"
- "Did the motion help or distract?"

**Sequence Questions:**
- "What happened first, second, third?"
- "Tell me the story/message in your own words"
- "Were any transitions confusing?"

#### For UX/Apps:

**Navigation Questions:**
- "How would you get to [destination]?"
- "Where are you right now in the app?"
- "How would you go back to where you started?"
- "Where would you look for [specific feature]?"

**Task Completion Questions:**
- "How would you [complete specific task]?"
- "What would you try first?"
- "What's stopping you from completing this?"
- "Did you accomplish what you were trying to do?"

**Understanding Questions:**
- "What can you do on this screen?"
- "What do you think these buttons/links do?"
- "What's the purpose of this section?"
- "How is this organized?"

**Mental Model Questions:**
- "How would you describe this app's structure?"
- "What category would you look in for [item]?"
- "Where do you expect this link to take you?"
- "Does this match what you expected?"

**Error Recovery Questions:**
- "What would you do if you got lost?"
- "How would you undo that?"
- "What if you changed your mind?"
- "Can you get back to where you were?"

---

## Methods for Identifying Questions (Early-Stage Focus)

### Method 1: The Critical Assumption Inventory

**What it is:** List all your assumptions about how users will interact with your work, then turn each assumption into a testable question.

#### For Installations:

1. **List spatial/interaction assumptions:**
   - "Visitors will see this from across the room first"
   - "People will understand this is interactive, not passive art"
   - "Users will try touching it rather than just watching"
   - "The interaction zone is clear without floor markings"
   - "Multiple people will want to engage simultaneously"
   - "People will feel comfortable approaching close enough to interact"

2. **Rank by risk:**
   - **Critical:** "If people don't realize it's interactive, the piece fails"
   - **Important:** "If people can't tell where to interact, engagement is limited"
   - **Minor:** "If people interact from the 'wrong' angle, it still mostly works"

3. **Convert to test questions:**
   - **Assumption:** "People will understand this is interactive"
   - **Question:** "What do you think this is? Is it something you can interact with or just observe?"
   
   - **Assumption:** "The projection surface will read as part of the piece"
   - **Question:** "What elements are part of the artwork?"

#### For Visual/Motion Media:

1. **List communication assumptions:**
   - "Viewers will read the headline before the body copy"
   - "The color red will signify urgency/importance"
   - "The animation will be watched from beginning to end"
   - "Viewers will understand the visual metaphor"
   - "Text will be legible from 10 feet away"

2. **Convert to test questions:**
   - **Assumption:** "Viewers will start with the headline"
   - **Question:** "What's the first thing you notice on this page?"
   
   - **Assumption:** "The metaphor is clear"
   - **Question:** "What do you think [visual element] represents?"

#### For UX/App Projects:

1. **List navigation/interaction assumptions:**
   - "Users will understand the tab structure"
   - "People will know to swipe/scroll to see more"
   - "The hamburger menu icon is obvious"
   - "Users will read the onboarding screens"
   - "The search icon will be noticed"
   - "Users will understand the card-based layout"

2. **Rank by risk:**
   - **Critical:** "If users can't find the main navigation, the app fails"
   - **Important:** "If users don't understand the gesture controls, tasks will be frustrating"
   - **Minor:** "If users miss the settings icon initially, they'll find it eventually"

3. **Convert to test questions:**
   - **Assumption:** "Users will understand the tab structure"
   - **Question:** "How would you navigate between different sections of this app?"
   
   - **Assumption:** "The search icon will be noticed"
   - **Question:** "If you wanted to search for something, what would you do?"
   
   - **Assumption:** "Users will know to scroll for more content"
   - **Question:** "Is there more content here or is this everything?"

---

### Method 2: The Isolated Variable Method

**What it is:** Test ONE thing at a time by creating minimal prototypes that isolate specific elements.

#### For Installation Testing:

Test spatial and interaction variables separately:

**Test A: Form and Scale Only (cardboard mockup)**
- Question: "Does this feel like the right size?"
- Question: "Where would you naturally position yourself?"
- Don't test: Interaction model yet

**Test B: Interaction Model Only (simplified setup)**
- Use simple prop or screen
- Question: "Can you make something happen?"
- Question: "What gestures/actions did you try?"
- Don't worry: About final form

**Test C: Response/Feedback Only (video mockup)**
- Show what the interaction would look like
- Question: "Is this response clear and immediate?"
- Question: "Does the feedback match the input?"
- Don't test: How user triggers it

#### For Motion Media Testing:

**Test A: Timing Only (animatic/storyboard)**
- Use rough sketches with correct timing
- Question: "Can you follow the sequence?"
- Question: "Does any part feel too fast or slow?"
- Don't test: Visual style yet

**Test B: Visual Style Only (static frames)**
- Show key frames with visual treatment
- Question: "What's the mood/tone of this?"
- Question: "Does this style feel appropriate?"
- Don't test: Motion yet

**Test C: Motion Quality Only (simple shapes)**
- Animate simple elements with final motion
- Question: "Does this movement feel natural/mechanical/fluid?"
- Question: "Is the easing/acceleration working?"
- Don't test: Visual complexity

#### For UX/App Testing:

Test navigation and interaction patterns separately:

**Test A: Information Architecture Only (card sorting / tree testing)**
- Question: "Where would you look for [feature]?"
- Question: "How would you categorize these items?"
- Don't test: Visual design or interactions yet

**Test B: Navigation Pattern Only (simple wireframes)**
- Use basic shapes to show structure
- Question: "How would you move between sections?"
- Question: "Can you find your way back?"
- Don't worry: About content or visual design

**Test C: Interaction Pattern Only (single feature)**
- Test one gesture or interaction
- Question: "How would you [delete/save/share] this?"
- Question: "What happens when you tap here?"
- Don't test: Full workflow yet

### Method 3: The Progressive Disclosure Test

**What it is:** Test concept → rough interaction → refined version in sequence with the same users.

#### For Installation Development:

**Version 1: Concept (verbal description + sketches)**
- "I'm creating an installation where shadows cast on a wall become animated when you move"
- Questions: "What would you expect this to look like?" "How would you interact?"

**Version 2: Spatial mockup (cardboard in space)**
- Physical form at scale, no electronics
- Questions: "How does the scale feel?" "Where would you stand?"

**Version 3: Interaction model (Wizard of Oz)**
- You manually trigger responses
- Questions: "How does the responsiveness feel?" "Is cause-and-effect clear?"

**Version 4: Technical prototype (working sensors)**
- Basic version with actual interaction
- Questions: "Is this what you expected?" "What's different from the concept?"

#### For Motion Graphics Development:

**Version 1: Concept (description + reference images)**
- "Title sequence where letters assemble from particles"
- Questions: "What style do you imagine?" "How fast should this be?"

**Version 2: Animatic (rough timing, simple shapes)**
- Boxes and placeholders at correct timing
- Questions: "Can you follow this?" "Is the pacing right?"

**Version 3: Style frames (static key moments)**
- Designed look without motion
- Questions: "Does this visual direction work?" "What stands out?"

**Version 4: Motion test (one section polished)**
- Single sequence with final motion
- Questions: "Does this match expectations?" "How does motion affect the feel?"

#### For UX/App Development:

**Version 1: Concept (verbal description or sketches)**
- "An app that helps you track shared expenses with roommates"
- Questions: "How would you expect to enter expenses?" "What would the main screen show?"

**Version 2: Information architecture (sitemap/card sort)**
- Show structure without design
- Questions: "Does this organization make sense?" "Where would you look for [feature]?"

**Version 3: Paper wireframes (sketches of screens)**
- Draw rough layouts on paper
- Questions: "Can you figure out how to navigate?" "What would you tap first?"

**Version 4: Digital wireframe (clickable prototype)**
- Basic clickable prototype
- Questions: "Complete this task" "Is this what you expected?"

**Compare across versions:**
- Where did understanding improve?
- What assumptions held up vs. broke down?
- What gaps exist between concept and execution?

---

### Method 4: The Core Loop/Sequence Extraction

**What it is:** Identify the fundamental repeating interaction, test only that loop.

#### For Games:
```
See enemy → Aim → Shoot → Hit/Miss → Feedback
[This is your loop—test ONLY this, not levels, story, etc.]
```

#### For Installations:
```
Approach → Trigger interaction → Receive feedback → Understand cause
[Test ONLY this cycle, not full experience]
```

#### For Interfaces:
```
See information → Locate control → Activate → See result
[Test ONLY this sequence]
```

#### For UX/Apps:

1. **Define your core user flow** (the most important task):

**Example - Social media app:**
```
Open app → See feed → Find post to engage with → 
Engage (like/comment/share) → See confirmation → 
Return to feed
```

**Example - E-commerce app:**
```
Search/browse → View product → Add to cart → 
View cart → Checkout → Confirm order
```

2. **Build minimal version of just the flow**
- Only screens needed for core task
- Minimal content and options
- Focus on essential path

3. **Write questions for each step of the flow:**

**Using e-commerce example:**
- **Search/browse:** "How would you find [product]?"
- **View product:** "What information do you need to decide?"
- **Add to cart:** "How would you add this to purchase?"
- **View cart:** "How do you see what you're buying?"
- **Checkout:** "What would you do next to complete the purchase?"
- **Confirm:** "Did you successfully complete your order? How do you know?"

4. **Test flow completion:**
- "Try to complete this task again"
- "Was it easier the second time?"
- "What would make this smoother?"

---

### Method 5: The "Wizard of Oz" Scenario Testing

**What it is:** Test interactions not yet implemented by manually creating responses while users think it's automatic.

#### For Installation Testing:

**Example - Interactive floor projection:**

**Can't build yet:** Computer vision tracking multiple people
**Wizard solution:** Observer watches and clicks to trigger visuals
**User thinks:** Floor responds to their movement
**You learn:** 
- Where do people naturally step?
- How do they test the boundaries?
- What movements do they try?
- How much responsiveness is needed?

**Questions during test:**
- "How is the floor responding to you?"
- "Try to make something specific happen"
- "Is the response fast enough?"
- "What other movements would you try?"

#### For Sound-Reactive Installations:

**Example - Visual piece that responds to voice/music:**

**Can't build yet:** Real-time audio analysis
**Wizard solution:** You listen and trigger responses
**User thinks:** Their voice creates visuals
**You learn:**
- What kinds of sounds do people make naturally?
- Do they speak, sing, clap, or something else?
- How loud/varied are their inputs?
- Do they expect instant or delayed response?

**Questions during test:**
- "What are you trying to make it do?"
- "What kind of sounds work best?"
- "Is the visual response matching your audio?"

#### For UX/Apps:

**For Search/Filter Functionality:**

**Can't build yet:** Real search algorithm
**Wizard solution:** You manually show pre-made results
**User thinks:** Search is working
**You learn:** What search terms they use, what filters they expect

**Questions during test:**
- "What are you searching for?"
- "How would you narrow these results?"
- "Is this what you expected to find?"

#### For Personalization/Recommendations:

**Can't build yet:** Real recommendation engine
**Wizard solution:** You show curated recommendations based on their profile
**User thinks:** App is learning their preferences
**You learn:** What makes recommendations useful vs. creepy

**Questions:**
- "How relevant are these recommendations?"
- "What would make these better?"
- "How did the app know to suggest this?"

---

### Method 6: The Task-Based Flow Analysis

**NEW METHOD specifically for UX/apps:**

1. **Identify top 3-5 user tasks:**
   - What users come to your app to do
   - Ranked by frequency and importance

**Example - Recipe app:**
1. Find a recipe by ingredient
2. Save recipe for later
3. Follow recipe while cooking
4. Create shopping list from recipe
5. Share recipe with friend

2. **Map the ideal flow for each task:**
   - List every screen and decision point
   - Identify where users might get stuck

**Example - "Find recipe by ingredient":**
```
Home screen → [Find search] → 
[Type ingredient] → [See results] → 
[Filter by dietary needs] → [Select recipe]
```

3. **Identify potential failure points:**
   - Can't find search
   - Don't know how to filter
   - Results don't match expectations
   - Selected recipe doesn't have ingredient

4. **Write questions for each failure point:**

**Failure: Can't find search**
- Question: "How would you find recipes with chicken?"

**Failure: Don't know how to filter**
- Question: "Can you find vegetarian recipes?"

**Failure: Results don't match expectations**
- Question: "Are these the recipes you expected?"

### Method 7: The Spatial/Temporal Analysis Method

**NEW METHOD specifically for installations and motion work:**

#### For Installation Spatial Testing:

1. **Map the approach sequence:**
   - 20 feet away (first noticing)
   - 10 feet away (getting interested)
   - 5 feet away (deciding to engage)
   - 2 feet away (interacting)
   - Intimate distance (full engagement)

2. **Test questions at each distance:**

**20 feet:**
- "What do you notice in this space?"
- "Is your attention drawn anywhere?"

**10 feet:**
- "What is that?"
- "Can you interact with it?"

**5 feet:**
- "How would you interact with this?"
- "Where do you think you should be?"

**2 feet:**
- "What happens when you [action]?"
- "Is this responsive to you?"

**Intimate:**
- "How does this feel?"
- "What details do you notice up close?"

3. **Identify critical failure points:**
   - Where do people lose interest?
   - Where do they get confused about what to do?
   - Where do they feel they should stop approaching?

#### For Motion/Animation Temporal Testing:

1. **Map the viewing timeline:**
   - First 2 seconds (hook)
   - 2-5 seconds (context)
   - 5-15 seconds (content/action)
   - 15-30 seconds (development)
   - Final moments (conclusion)

2. **Test comprehension at each phase:**

**0-2 sec:**
- "What did you see?" (test immediate hook)
- "Did this catch your attention?"

**2-5 sec:**
- "What's happening?"
- "What do you expect to see next?"

**5-15 sec:**
- "Can you still follow this?"
- "Where are you looking?"

**15-30 sec:**
- "Are you still engaged?"
- "What's developed since the beginning?"

**End:**
- "What was that about?"
- "What will you remember from this?"

---

### Method 8: The Environmental Context Method

**NEW METHOD specifically for installation and public work:**

1. **Identify your intended context:**
   - Gallery white cube?
   - Public plaza?
   - Dark room?
   - Outdoor space?
   - Mixed-use space?

2. **Simulate context variables:**

**Lighting:**
- Test with similar lighting conditions
- Questions: "Can you see [element]?" "Does ambient light interfere?"

**Ambient sound:**
- Test with expected background noise
- Questions: "Can you hear the feedback?" "Is it overwhelming or subtle?"

**Traffic flow:**
- Simulate people passing through vs. stopping
- Questions: "Would you stop for this?" "How long would you stay?"

**Social density:**
- Test with multiple people present
- Questions: "Do you feel crowded?" "Can others interact while you are?"

3. **Context-specific questions:**

**Gallery context:**
- "Does this feel like art you observe or participate with?"
- "How long would you spend with this in a museum?"
- "Would you wait in line for this?"

**Public space context:**
- "Would this work with people walking by?"
- "Is it clear this is intentional (not broken)?"
- "Does weather/time of day matter?"

---

### Method 9: The Viewer Distance/Duration Method

**NEW METHOD specifically for visual and motion media:**

#### For Static Media (Posters, Graphics):

1. **Identify viewing distances:**
   - Far: 20-30 feet (passing by)
   - Medium: 10 feet (interested)
   - Near: 2-3 feet (reading closely)

2. **Test hierarchy at each distance:**

**Far test (what's visible from across the room):**
- "What do you see from here?"
- "What catches your eye?"
- "Can you read anything?"

**Medium test (comfortable viewing):**
- "What's the main message?"
- "What information is available at this distance?"

**Near test (detailed reading):**
- "What details emerge up close?"
- "Is anything hard to read even from here?"

3. **Duration-based questions:**

**3-second glance:**
- "What did you notice?"
- "Could you get the main idea?"

**30-second look:**
- "What new details did you find?"
- "Is there enough to hold attention?"

#### For Motion Media (Animation, Video):

1. **Identify expected viewing duration:**
   - 5-second social media clip?
   - 30-second explainer?
   - 2-minute video?
   - 5+ minute film?

2. **Test at critical timestamps:**

**For 30-second piece:**
- 0-5 sec: "Are you hooked?"
- 10 sec: "Do you know what this is about?"
- 20 sec: "Are you still engaged?"
- 30 sec: "Did you watch to the end? Why/why not?"

**For longer pieces:**
- Test first 30 seconds heavily (retention critical)
- Test 1-2 midpoint moments (maintaining interest)
- Test ending (memorability)

---

### Method 10: The Error Path Testing Method

**NEW METHOD specifically for UX/apps:**

1. **Intentionally create error scenarios:**
   - Have users try to do something impossible
   - Remove expected content/features
   - Break part of the flow
   - Give conflicting information

2. **Watch what users do when stuck:**

**Example scenarios:**
- "Try to find a product that doesn't exist"
- "Complete checkout without entering payment"
- "Navigate to a section you've removed"
- "Undo an action that can't be undone"

3. **Questions during errors:**
   - "What are you trying to do right now?"
   - "How would you get unstuck?"
   - "What would you expect to happen?"
   - "How would you describe what went wrong?"

4. **Learn about:**
   - Error prevention (do they see it coming?)
   - Error recovery (can they get back on track?)
   - Error messaging (what would help?)
   - Expectations (what should have happened?)

## Testing Different Prototype Fidelities

### Paper Prototypes (All Media)

#### For Installations:

**Best for:**
- Spatial relationships and scale
- Visitor flow and positioning
- Form factor and presence
- Interaction point locations
- Multi-user space negotiation

**How to build:**
- Cardboard boxes for volume

---

### Interactive Prototypes (Low-Fi)

#### For Installation Interactions:

**Best for:**
- Sensor responsiveness
- Timing of feedback
- Technical feasibility
- Multi-user interaction

**What to build:**
- Arduino + simple sensor
- Webcam tracking (basic)

**Common mistake:** Over-building - test before adding features

**Pro tip:** Use real device for mobile prototypes, not desktop simulator

---

### Physical Mockups & Scale Models

#### For Installations (CRITICAL for spatial work):

**Full-scale mockups:**

**Why full-scale matters:**
- Human body proportions only make sense at 1:1
- Reach, comfort, sightlines can't be tested at small scale
- Emotional impact of scale is critical

**What to build:**
- Actual-size forms in cheap materials
- PVC pipe frames
- Cardboard and hot glue
- Projection surfaces (even white fabric)
- Floor tape for positioning

**Test in actual space if possible:**
- Ceiling height affects perception
- Natural vs. artificial light changes everything
- Ambient sound affects audio elements
- Traffic patterns emerge

**Questions specific to full-scale:**
- "Can you comfortably reach this?" (have them try)
- "Do you feel too close/far?"
- "Is this intimidating or inviting at this size?"
- "Where's your natural standing position?"
- "Would you crouch/bend/stretch to interact?"

**1:10 or 1:20 scale models:**

**Best for:**
- Overall spatial planning
- Multiple piece arrangements
- Sightline studies
- Gallery/room layout

**What to build:**
- Foamcore or basswood
- 3D printed elements
- Photographed in space mockup
- Multiple viewing angles

**Questions to ask:**
- "Looking at this room layout, what draws attention?"
- "How would you move through this space?"
- "Do pieces compete or complement?"

**Common mistake:** Testing only at small scale - you MUST test at full scale before finalizing

## The Think Aloud Protocol

### What Is It?

**Think Aloud Protocol (TAP)** involves participants verbalizing their thoughts in real-time while interacting with your work. It's considered the single most valuable usability testing method.

### How to Implement

#### 1. Explain It Clearly
"Please say out loud everything you're thinking as you play/interact/use this. Tell me what you're looking at, what you're thinking, what you're trying to do, and how you're feeling."

#### 2. Demonstrate
Show them what you mean with a simple practice task:
- "Tell me out loud how many doors you have in your home"
- This helps them understand the level of detail you want

#### 3. During the Session

**Your only prompts should be:**
- "Keep thinking out loud"
- "What are you thinking right now?"
- "What did you expect to happen?"
- "Tell me more about that"
- "Please continue verbalizing your thoughts"

**DO NOT:**
- Answer their questions
- Explain how things work
- Confirm if they're "doing it right"
- Guide them toward solutions

**When they ask a question, respond with:**
- "What do you think will happen?"
- "What would you do if I wasn't here?"
- "There's no right or wrong way—just do what feels natural"

### What You'll Learn

- Where users get confused (even briefly)
- What they expect to happen
- How they make decisions
- What catches their attention
- When they feel frustrated or delighted
- Their mental model of how things work

### Types of Think Aloud

**Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA):** Users speak while performing tasks (most common)

**Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA):** Users complete tasks silently, then watch a recording and describe what they were thinking

---

### Adapted for Installations and Visual Media

#### For Interactive Installations:

**Modified introduction:**
"This is a prototype of an interactive installation. While you explore and interact with it, please tell me what you're thinking, feeling, and trying to do. Describe what you notice, what you're curious about, and what confuses you."

**Installation-specific prompts:**
- "What are you noticing right now?"
- "What made you want to touch/approach that?"
- "How does the space feel?"
- "What are you expecting to happen?"
- "How does your body want to position itself?"

**Physical observation notes (beyond verbal):**
- Where do they look first?
- How do they approach (confident vs. tentative)?
- What's their body posture (leaning in vs. holding back)?
- Do they reach out tentatively or boldly?
- How long do they engage?
- Do they invite others to join?

**Example dialogue:**
- **Visitor:** *walks slowly toward installation*
- **You:** "What are you thinking as you approach?"
- **Visitor:** "I'm not sure if I'm allowed to touch it"
- **You:** "What makes you unsure?"
- **Visitor:** "It looks fragile, and there's no sign"
- [CRITICAL INSIGHT: Need clearer invitation to interact]

---

#### For Visual/Motion Media:

**Modified introduction:**
"I'm going to show you [poster/animation/video]. Please describe what you see, what catches your attention, and what you think it's communicating. There's no right or wrong answer."

**Visual media prompts:**
- "What are you looking at right now?"
- "What do you notice next?"
- "What does this remind you of?"
- "What's the main thing you're taking away?"

**For motion work:**
- "What just happened?"
- "Where were you looking?"
- "Did you miss anything?"
- "Should I replay that?"

**Eye-tracking observations (without equipment):**
- Watch where their eyes go first
- Notice scanning patterns
- See when they squint or lean in
- Observe when attention wanders

**Example dialogue for animation:**
- **Viewer:** *watching 15-second animation*
- **You:** *after it ends* "What happened?"
- **Viewer:** "Something about... particles? They formed text?"
- **You:** "Did you catch what the text said?"
- **Viewer:** "Not really, it happened too fast"
- [CRITICAL INSIGHT: Key moment needs more time]

---

### Adapted for UX/Apps

**Setting Up Think Aloud for Apps:**

**Your introduction:**
"This is a prototype testing [navigation/task flow/feature]. Some things aren't built yet—[list missing elements]. While you use it, please think out loud. Tell me what you're looking for, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. There are no wrong answers—I'm testing the design, not you."

#### During the Session:

**Standard prompts:**
- "What are you looking for right now?"
- "What are you trying to do?"
- "What do you expect will happen?"
- "What are you thinking?"

**App-specific prompts:**
- "Where would you tap next?"
- "Can you find [feature]?"
- "What does this button do?"
- "How would you describe where you are in the app?"

**DO NOT:**
- Tell them where to tap
- Explain what features do
- Guide them to the "right" path
- Confirm they're doing it correctly

**When they ask questions, respond with:**
- "What do you think it does?"
- "What would you try?"
- "Where would you look for that?"

#### Example Dialogue:

**User:** *stops and looks around screen*
**You:** "What are you looking for?"
**User:** "I want to see my past orders"
**You:** "Where would you look for that?"
**User:** "Maybe in this menu?" *taps*
**You:** "What were you expecting to see?"
**User:** "Order history or something, but this just showed settings"
[CRITICAL INSIGHT: "My Orders" not in expected location]

---

### Handling Prototype Comments Across Media

#### For Installation Mockups:

**User:** "This is cardboard, not the real materials"
**You:** "Right - focus on the form and where you'd interact. The final materials don't change that."

**User:** "There's no lights or sound"
**You:** "Correct - imagine those elements. Right now, does the physical form work?"

**User:** "This looks temporary/rough"
**You:** "It's intentionally rough. Does the scale and position feel right?"

#### For Visual Comps:

**User:** "The images are pixelated/blurry"
**You:** "Yes, they're placeholders. Focus on the layout - is the hierarchy clear?"

**User:** "The colors seem off"
**You:** "This is testing structure, not final color. What grabs your attention first?"

#### For Animation Animatics:

**User:** "The animation is choppy"
**You:** "Right, this is testing timing, not smoothness. Can you follow the sequence?"

**User:** "There's no sound"
**You:** "Correct - focus on whether the visuals alone communicate the idea."

#### For App Wireframes:

**User:** "This doesn't have real content"
**You:** "Right - I'm testing if the structure and navigation work. Even with placeholder content, can you find what you need?"

**User:** "The design is basic"
**You:** "Correct - this tests functionality first. Can you complete the task?"

**User:** "This button doesn't work"
**You:** "That feature isn't built yet. Based on what is working, can you [task]?"

## Context-Specific Questions for In-Progress Work

### For Game Prototypes

#### Concept Stage (Verbal Description/Paper)

**Pre-Test:**
- "What types of games do you usually play?"
- "I'm going to describe a game concept—stop me if anything is confusing"

**During Description:**
- "Based on what I've said so far, what do you think the core gameplay is?"
- "What would you expect controlling this game to feel like?"
- "How is this different from games you know?"

**Post Description:**

### During the Session

#### The Critical Introduction (Medium-Specific)

**For Installation Testing:**
"Thanks for helping test this installation concept. This is a [scale model / full-size mockup / spatial test] made of [materials]. The final piece will have [list missing elements like lighting, sound, sensors]. What I'm trying to learn is: [critical question about space/interaction/experience]. Please move around naturally and interact however feels right. Focus on [spatial relationship/interaction model], not the rough materials."

**For Visual Media Testing:**
"Thanks for helping test this [poster/graphic/layout]. This is a rough [sketch/wireframe/comp] testing [hierarchy/clarity/readability]. The final will have [final typography/photography/illustration]. What I'm trying to learn is: [critical question about communication/hierarchy]. Please look at this from [specified distance] and tell me what you see. Focus on [what stands out/message clarity], not visual polish."

**For Motion Media Testing:**
"Thanks for helping test this [animation/video/sequence]. This is a [storyboard/animatic/rough cut] testing [timing/sequence/pacing]. The final will have [polished animation/color/sound]. What I'm trying to learn is: [critical question about comprehension/pacing]. Please watch and tell me if you can follow what's happening. Focus on [sequence clarity/timing], not visual refinement."

**For UX/App Testing:**
"Thanks for helping test this [app/website] prototype. This is testing [navigation/specific feature/task flow]. The visual design isn't final, and [list missing elements] don't work yet. I want to learn: [critical question]. I'll give you tasks to try - please think out loud as you work, and tell me what you're looking for and what you expect to happen. Focus on [whether you can complete tasks/if navigation makes sense], not on how it looks."

---

#### Managing Incompleteness Concerns (Medium-Specific)

**Installation Context:**

**User:** "This is just cardboard"
**You:** "Right - the final materials won't change where you stand or how you interact. Does the form and scale work?"

**User:** "Where are the lights/projections/sounds?"
**You:** "Those will be added later. Right now, can you understand the interaction model?"

**User:** "This feels rough/temporary"
**You:** "Intentionally - I'm testing spatial relationships first. How does the space feel to move through?"

---

**Visual Media Context:**

**User:** "The images are just placeholders"
**You:** "Correct - focus on what's grabbing your attention first. Does the hierarchy work?"

**User:** "This isn't the real typography"
**You:** "True - but can you read the information at this size? Is the layout clear?"

**User:** "These colors aren't final, right?"
**You:** "Right - I'm testing structure. Even with placeholder colors, what stands out?"

---

**Motion Media Context:**

**User:** "The animation is rough/choppy"
**You:** "Yes - this tests timing, not smoothness. Could you follow the sequence?"

**User:** "There's no sound"
**You:** "Correct - does the visual sequence make sense on its own?"

**User:** "Is this the final style?"
**You:** "No - but at this timing and pacing, can you understand what's happening?"

---

**UX/App Context:**

**User:** "This doesn't have real content"
**You:** "Right - I'm testing if the structure and navigation work. Even with placeholder content, can you find what you need?"

**User:** "The design is basic"
**You:** "Correct - this tests functionality first. Can you complete the task?"

**User:** "This button doesn't work"
**You:** "That feature isn't built yet. Based on what is working, can you [task]?"

- Do they watch all the way through?
- What makes them want to replay?

**Comprehension signals:**
- Nodding (understanding)
- Furrowed brow (confusion)
- Looking away then back (processing)
- Asking to pause (information overload)

**Emotional responses:**
- Smiling, laughing (positive engagement)
- Frustration (pacing too fast, clarity issues)
- Boredom (pacing too slow, not enough happening)

---

#### For UX/App Testing - Navigation Behaviors:

**Hesitation points:**
- Where do they pause before acting?
- What makes them backtrack?
- When do they try multiple things?

**Scrolling behavior:**
- Do they scroll to find more content?
- Do they miss content below fold?
- Do they scroll past important elements?

**Tap targets:**
- What do they try to tap that isn't tappable?
- Do they miss small tap targets?
- Do they tap wrong elements?

**Navigation patterns:**
- How do they move between sections?
- Do they use back button or navigation?
- Can they return to where they started?

**Error recovery:**
- What do they try when stuck?
- Do they use back button?
- Do they give up or persevere?

### After the Session

#### Medium-Specific Analysis:

**For Installation Tests, prioritize:**
1. Spatial failures (people can't find interaction point)
2. Comfort/safety issues (people feel physically awkward)
3. Social dynamic problems (people don't know how to share space)
4. Misunderstood interactions (tried wrong action)
5. Scale issues (too big/small/tall/close)

**For Visual Media Tests, prioritize:**
1. Hierarchy failures (wrong thing seen first)
2. Comprehension problems (message unclear)
3. Readability issues (can't read from distance)
4. Attention competition (multiple elements fighting)
5. Style mismatch (doesn't feel appropriate)

**For Motion Media Tests, prioritize:**
1. Sequence confusion (couldn't follow what happened)
2. Pacing problems (too fast or too slow)
3. Attention losses (when viewers disengage)
4. Missing information (went too fast to catch)
5. Unnecessary duration (sections that could be cut)

**For UX/App Tests, prioritize:**
1. Critical usability failures (user can't complete core tasks)
2. Major friction points (user struggles significantly)
3. Minor issues (user eventually succeeds)

**Distinguish between:**

**Usability problems** (structural issues)
- "I couldn't find where to log in"
- "I didn't know I could tap that"
- "I thought this button did something else"

**Feature requests** (wanting different functionality)
- "I wish it also did X"
- "Other apps have Y feature"
- "Can you add Z?"

**Visual design feedback** (when you're not testing visuals)
- "I don't like these colors"
- "This font is hard to read"
- "Can you make it look more modern?"

## Quick Reference Materials

### The 5-Question Starter Set (By Medium)

#### For Installation Testing:
1. "What is this?" (concept comprehension)
2. "How would you interact with it?" (interaction model)
3. "Where would you stand/position yourself?" (spatial relationship)
4. "What do you think causes it to respond?" (cause-effect understanding)
5. "How does being in this space make you feel?" (emotional impact)

#### For Visual Media Testing:
1. "What do you notice first?" (hierarchy)
2. "What is this communicating?" (message clarity)
3. "From where you're standing, what can you read?" (readability)
4. "What's the mood or feeling of this?" (aesthetic appropriateness)
5. "Who is this for?" (audience appropriateness)

#### For Motion Media Testing:
1. "What just happened?" (sequence comprehension)
2. "Was that too fast, too slow, or just right?" (pacing)
3. "Where were you looking?" (attention tracking)
4. "Could you follow the whole sequence?" (continuity)
5. "Would you watch this again?" (engagement)

#### For UX/App Testing:
1. "How would you [complete specific task]?" (task completion)
2. "Where would you look for [feature]?" (navigation)
3. "What do you expect this button/link to do?" (mental model)
4. "Can you get back to where you started?" (orientation)
5. "What's confusing about this?" (pain points)

### Common Question Mistakes & Fixes (Medium-Specific)

#### For Installation Testing:

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | How to Fix |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| "Do you like the installation?" | Subjective preference, not useful | "How does the space make you feel?" |
| "Is it obvious what to do?" | Leading, assumes something | "What would you try to do?" |
| "The sensors will make it respond" | Explaining instead of testing | "What do you think makes it respond?" |
| "Would you touch this?" | May not reflect actual behavior | *Observe what they actually do* |

#### For Visual Media Testing:

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | How to Fix |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| "Is the hierarchy clear?" | Assumes there is one | "What do you see first, second, third?" |
| "Can you read this?" | Yes/no, not helpful | "From where you are, what can you read?" |
| "Do you like the colors?" | Subjective, not functional | "What do the colors communicate?" |
| "Is this easy to understand?" | Leading with "easy" | "What is this telling you?" |

#### For Motion Media Testing:

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | How to Fix |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| "Was that too fast?" | Leading toward one answer | "How was the pacing?" |
| "Did you see the transition?" | Yes/no, may lie | "What happened between those two moments?" |
| "Is the animation smooth?" | About polish, not what you're testing | "Could you follow the movement?" |
| "Do you like this style?" | Preference, not clarity | "Does the motion enhance or distract from meaning?" |

#### For UX/App Testing:

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | How to Fix |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| "Is the navigation clear?" | Assumes there is clear nav, yes/no | "How would you get to [section]?" |
| "Do you like this layout?" | Subjective preference | "Can you find [specific element]?" |
| "Would you use this app?" | Too general, hypothetical | "Try to complete [specific task]" |
| "Click here to go to settings" | Giving instructions | "How would you change your password?" |
| "Can you figure out what to do?" | Vague, yes/no | "What can you do on this screen?" |
| "Is this intuitive?" | Loaded word, meaningless | "How did you figure out how to [action]?" |

## Final Reminders for Early-Stage Testing

### The Core Principle
**Test spatial relationships, visual hierarchy, sequence clarity, and navigation structure before worrying about materials, polish, or final execution.**

### Medium-Specific Mantras

**For Installation Work:**
*"Test the space before you build the tech. Test the form before you choose the materials. Test the interaction before you wire the sensors."*

**For Visual Media:**
*"Test the hierarchy before you design. Test the structure before you style. Test the readability before you refine."*

**For Motion Media:**
*"Test the sequence before you animate. Test the timing before you polish. Test the comprehension before you render."*

**For UX/Apps:**
*"Test the navigation before you design. Test the task flow before you build features. Test with paper before you code."*

### The Permission Slip
**Cardboard installations, sharpie sketches, flipbook animatics, and paper app prototypes are not just acceptable—they're often better for testing than polished prototypes.**

### The Reality Check
**If 3+ people don't understand your spatial relationship / visual hierarchy / sequence / navigation structure, it's not the execution—it's the concept.**

### The UX Reminder
**Users will complete tasks the "wrong" way. That's not wrong—that's your design failing to match their mental model. Change your design, not your users.**

---

**Good luck with your testing sessions! Remember: The rougher your prototype, the more focused your test, the more useful your feedback. Test early, test often, test what matters most.**
